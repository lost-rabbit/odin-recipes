                <h4>Holy Thai Basil</h4>

                <p>
                    Let me be completly honest with you. This is just complicated cheese you make yourself and then eat with coffee. I don't know how to make it, but I do know how to eat it. Well outside the directions below. 
                </p>
                <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 Liters of milk</li>
                    <li>60 ml heavy cream</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoon rennet</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour the milk and cream in a 3-liter saucepan</li>
                    <li>Heat to lukewarm (37C)</li>
                    <li>Lift off the pan and mix in rennet. Let stand for about 30-40 minutes until the liquid has solidified (curdled itself)</li>
                    <li>Stir gently with a slotted spoon while you heat up the liquid to lukewarm again</li>
                    <li>Steer the cheese from the edges toward the center of the pan</li>
                    <li>When the cheese is gathered into a ball in the middle heat the whole thing up to the boiling point but it should not boil! Take the pan off the heat just before the whey boils</li>
                    <li>Place the cheese in a fine mesh colander / strainer large / or in a cheese mold if you have one of those</li>
                    <li>Press out as much whey as possible out of the cheese. Set a weight and leave for a few hours so the last whey is pressed out and the cheese gets dry</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Press the cheese into a well greased casserole dish - cheese should be a maximum of 3 cm thick. Bake the cheese in center of oven until browned. The cheese can also be used without baking but I think it will be tastier to bake it</li>
                    <li>If the edges become hard - wrap the warm cheese in aluminum foil afterwards so they soften</li>
                    <li>When the cheese has cooled - cut into small cubes or strips, put a pile in the coffee cup and fill the cup with fresh coffee .</li>
                    <li>Stir and eat with a spoon</li>

                    
                </ol>
